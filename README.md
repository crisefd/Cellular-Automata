# Elementary Cellular-Automata
Python implementation of an 1-D Celullar Automata

Final project of the course of Artificial Life, 
School of Systems Engineering and Computation of the Universidad del Valle (Colombia)

The objective of this project is to implement one-dimensional Cellular Automata
Using the basic set of rules found at : http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html

# Implementation Details
>Python3

>Gtk 3.0

>Programmed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04

#Using the Sofware
>Execute in terminal with command: python3 CAGUI.py

>Choose the number of cells and generations

>Click with cursor the cells in the first row

> Go to the menubar and select 'Evolve'
